How to play the full game:
---

To play the full game you will need to own the original files. You can get Tomb Raider Classic (1996) from Steam and GoG or buy Tomb Raider Remastered (2024). Both versions include the files needed to play this port.

To extract the needed files from your Tomb Raider (1969) or Remastered installation, please use our "Beef Raider Extraction Tool". Download it from the Releases area on this repo.

1. Unzip the tool to your PC and open it by running SauronDesktop.exe (you may be prompted to install the .Net 7.0 runtime)
2. Click "Locate from Steam" to let it automaticaly recognize your Tomb Raider (Steam) install folder or search it manually (GoG).
3. Once the correct install folder is detected click "Extract Files".
4. Click "Download Audio Tracks" to download a converted version of the original soundtrack.
5. Click the "Open Mod Folder" and run BeefRaider.exe.

You should select you default OpenXR runtime (Steam or Meta). Generally if you are using Airlink / Link we recommend Meta. Virtual Desktop / Steam Link / WMR, better to use the Steam OpenXR runtime.
